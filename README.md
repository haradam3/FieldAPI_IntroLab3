# Field API Intro Lab 3 - Field API Web Intro

This is a part of introductory materials for BIM 360 Field API discussed here:

https://fieldofviewblog.wordpress.com/2015/04/02/field-api-intro-labs-overview/

The labs consist of four modules. Starting from Lab 1, it incrementally 
adds code or reuse the code you have written, and implement a simple web service application  

In the previous two labs, Lab1 and Lab2, we looked at Field API as desktop client applications. In this lab, we write a minimum, single page web service application in APS.NET. We will reuse most of Field API call itself, and add UI layers as a web page. 

**How to run the sample project**
